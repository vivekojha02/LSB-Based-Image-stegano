# LSB-Based-Image-stegano
This project uses Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography to hide secret messages within images, enabling discreet and secure communication without altering visual quality. It reduces detection risk compared to encryption, supports various image formats, and offers adaptive embedding with optional encryption.
